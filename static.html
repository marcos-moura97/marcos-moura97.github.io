            transfer learning was fine-tuning. Different proportions of real
            data were used, to evaluate the performance aiming to reduce the
            reliance on real-world datasets.

          <h3>Road Weather Forecasts in Norway with the METRo Model</h3>
          <p>
            In this paper, in which I worked in the API development and data
            curation, we evaluate road weather forecasts in Norway using the
            METRo model in a quasi-operational setup. Initialized with road
            weather station data and mesoscale forecasts, the model focuses on
            predicting freezing road-surface temperatures‚Äîa key hazard in
            Norway. By comparing hit and false-alarm rates to climatology, we
            show that METRo adds consistent skill, especially in winter, spring,
            and fall. This study demonstrates a feasible, open-source approach
            to operational road weather forecasting using accessible data.

            Development of a Solar Panel Control Strategy for Tracking Maximum

          <p>
            In this work, in which I was a co-author, we describe the prototype
            of an electronic supervision and control system for the orientation
            of a bench solar panel. The developed tracker prototype has as its
            core an electronic circuit based on a commercial microcontroller
            model Tennsy 3.0, within which the control algorithm is embedded. In
            addition to the controller, a supervisory software was developed to
            monitor solar cells' status in real-time. The supervisory showed the
            angle of the solar plate and values of luminosity and acquired
            power. Simulations results were presented to show that the amount of
            energy generated can reach 37 %.

            can improve maritime search and rescue missions using unmanned

            trained with various configurations‚Äîusing real, synthetic, and mixed

            Reflectance and transmittance spectra of a photonic crystal slab

          <p>
            This conference paper, in which I was main author, we present
            seminal results to characterize the performance of a two-dimensional
            photonic crystal slab waveguide with doped graphene disks for
            operation at the Tera-hertz spectrum. More specifically, we analyze
            the reflectance and transmittance spectra for frequencies ranging
            from 10 THz up to 20 THz. It is shown that a broader transmission
            spectrum can be achieved when compared to the analogous
            all-dielectric structure, suggesting promising applications for
            filtering performance at the THz domain.

          <h3>Design of a surface plasmon resonance flip flop S-R circuit</h3>
          <p>
            In my bachelor thesis, me and my supervisor explores the propagation
            characteristics of plasmonic modes to design an optical version of
            an S-R flip flop, a sequential digital circuit that can be used as a
            one-bit memory device. The performance of the structure and its
            operation as an SR flip flop is analyzed in terms of simulation
            results for the transmission spectrum, considered as the square
            magnitude of the S parameters ($|S_{ij}|^2$) between a pair of
            specified input-output.

            Currently, this package supports three types of waveguide: Planar,
            Retangular and Optical Fibers. This was developed during my studies
            in applied electromagnetism in my bachelor.

          <h3>PID Maximum Power Tracking</h3>
          <p>
            Implementation of a PID control for tracking the maximum power
            generation of a solar panel. The system is consisted of 2 LDRs, a
            Teensy 2.0, with a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4, SG90 servo and the HMI was
            made using Elipse Scada.

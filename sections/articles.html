              Optimizing Object Detection for Maritime Search and Rescue:
              Progressive Fine-Tuning of YOLOv9 with Real and Synthetic Data
            </h3>
            <p>
              In this work, in which I was a co-author, we keep exploring how
              mixed datasets can be used for transfer learning. Here, the use of
              real and synthetic data for training the model YOLOv9 in maritime
              search and rescue operations is explored. The technique used for
              transfer learning was fine-tuning. Different proportions of real
              data were used, to evaluate the performance aiming to reduce the
              reliance on real-world datasets.

            <h3>Road Weather Forecasts in Norway with the METRo Model</h3>
            <p>
              In this paper, in which I worked in the API development and data
              curation, we evaluate road weather forecasts in Norway using the
              METRo model in a quasi-operational setup. Initialized with road
              weather station data and mesoscale forecasts, the model focuses on
              predicting freezing road-surface temperatures—a key hazard in
              Norway. By comparing hit and false-alarm rates to climatology, we
              show that METRo adds consistent skill, especially in winter,
              spring, and fall. This study demonstrates a feasible, open-source
              approach to operational road weather forecasting using accessible
              data.

              Development of a Solar Panel Control Strategy for Tracking Maximum
              Power Generation
            </h3>
            <p>
              In this work, in which I was a co-author, we describe the
              prototype of an electronic supervision and control system for the
              orientation of a bench solar panel. The developed tracker
              prototype has as its core an electronic circuit based on a
              commercial microcontroller model Tennsy 3.0, within which the
              control algorithm is embedded. In addition to the controller, a
              supervisory software was developed to monitor solar cells' status
              in real-time. The supervisory showed the angle of the solar plate
              and values of luminosity and acquired power. Simulations results
              were presented to show that the amount of energy generated can
              reach 37 %.

              Empowering Search and Rescue Operations with Big Data Technology:
              A Comprehensive Study of YOLOv8 Transfer Learning for
              Transportation Safety
            </h3>
            <p>
              In this project, in which I was co-author, we explores how object
              detection, optimized through transfer learning and synthetic data,
              can improve maritime search and rescue missions using unmanned
              aerial vehicles. Due to limited real-world sea operation data and
              onboard processing constraints, the use of synthetic datasets and
              transfer learning offers a flexible solution. YOLOv8 models were
              trained with various configurations—using real, synthetic, and
              mixed datasets—under both regular and transfer learning setups.
              Performance was evaluated using mAP50-95, highlighting key
              differences between synthetic and real data in training outcomes.

              Reflectance and transmittance spectra of a photonic crystal slab
              with doped graphene disks for operation at the THz band
            </h3>
            <p>
              This conference paper, in which I was main author, we present
              seminal results to characterize the performance of a
              two-dimensional photonic crystal slab waveguide with doped
              graphene disks for operation at the Tera-hertz spectrum. More
              specifically, we analyze the reflectance and transmittance spectra
              for frequencies ranging from 10 THz up to 20 THz. It is shown that
              a broader transmission spectrum can be achieved when compared to
              the analogous all-dielectric structure, suggesting promising
              applications for filtering performance at the THz domain.

            <h3>Design of a surface plasmon resonance flip flop S-R circuit</h3>
            <p>
              In my bachelor thesis, me and my supervisor explores the
              propagation characteristics of plasmonic modes to design an
              optical version of an S-R flip flop, a sequential digital circuit
              that can be used as a one-bit memory device. The performance of
              the structure and its operation as an SR flip flop is analyzed in
              terms of simulation results for the transmission spectrum,
              considered as the square magnitude of the S parameters
              ($|S_{ij}|^2$) between a pair of specified input-output.
